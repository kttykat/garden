Discord embeds ( and other embeded versions e.g twitter ) are a nice addition to your next web applications. They allow someone to find out some basic information about what they expect to see aswell as other nice things.

Within this digital garden i use a image generator for the meta images. You can find the original ogmeta image generator [here](https://github.com/hopinc/ogmeta) and my customised version that used expressjs [here](https://github.com/kttykat/ogmeta). Under the hood the generator builds an static file with your generated image, deploys a [puppeter](https://pptr.dev/) window and takes a screen shot to return back to the requester.

An example of what i currently used can be found below.

```html
<meta property="og:site_name" content="Saige's Garden ðŸŒ¿" />
<meta property="og:title" content={name} />
<meta property="og:description" content={desc} />
<meta
	property="og:image"
	content={`https://ogmeta.saige.systems?title=${name}${
		desc ? `&desc=${desc}` : ""
	}${dark ? "&dark=true" : ""}`}
/>
<meta name="theme-color" content="#1e191b" />
<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image" />
```
Values such as "desc" and "name" are passed through as props to the base layout of this astro application.
The generated embed would look like the one below for this note.
