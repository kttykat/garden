[Cratal](https://github.com/withastard/cratal) is an template for your future SAAS apps. It is currently in a very early beta as of writing this, but i thought i should build something basic on how to get started with it.

### Getting started
First you will need to clone Cratal from its [github repository](https://github.com/withastard/cratal). You can use the following command todo so. This command will clone down Cratal and put its content into a folder of your choosing.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/withastard/cratal YOUR_APP_NAME
```


Next open Cratal in your editor of choice. Along with 2 seperate terminal windows.
Cratal requires that you fill out the "config.ts" files within both the "server" and the "client"


### Removing certain features

the following list will be layouted out as "feature - files to remove". Removing all of the files with permently remove that feature from cratal.

<Quote>
  The symbol "*" means everything, if this is placed after a directory just remove the directory as a whole.

Stripe - server/src/utils/providers/stripe.ts, server/src/routes/auth/upgrade.ts, server/src/routes/auth/upgrade/accept.ts
<br/>
Send Grid ( Emails ) -  server/src/utils/providers/sendGrid.ts
<br/>
Magic Link Auth - server/src/routes/auth/\*, client/src/pages/api/auth/*

This will only remove required files, some functions may still exist aswell as api calls within default components.
