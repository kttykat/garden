Personally i love the minimalistic style; it allows my small little brain to understand things easier because there isnt much going on around it to distract me.

Over the past year ( 2022 ) i have adapted a more and more minimalistic style which has allowed me to focus on the more imporant parts of my life. Personally ive had some great benefits such as: grades have been higher, easier to focus, more concentrated. Throughtout my day to day life ive removed more and more stuff that i realised i did not need and were just there because i could not be bothered to remove them.

This minimalistic style has recently been showing in my work/creations although i find myself always building more and more complex stuff just because others prefer it that way.
